#### 0/1 Knapsack Problem

**General Knapsack Problem:**
    Given a list of items (having some weight and value) and a knapsack with a fixed capacity, the problem is to try to
    obtain the most valuable items without going over the knapsack weight limit.

**Our Specific Knapsack Problem:**
    We use calories instead of weight, the context of the problem is: You are at a restaurant trying to eat the best
    food that you can without going over your daily allotted calorie limit.
